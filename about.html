						<h5>What led you to a career in web development?</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>Ever since I was young, I have always been adventurous and bold in trying something new no matter how difficult it was to learn. As a kid, I liked challenging myself to explore new opportunities whether it be learning another language, learning how to play piano, trying out for the basketball team despite not being as tall as other players, or striving to be one of the best chess players at school. I always found different ways to solve problems whether it be figuring out how to solve a difficult problem in math class, how to be a couple moves ahead of my chess opponent, or how to be an efficient three point shooter on the basketball court. Exploration, determination, and strategic thinking have been and still are a big part of who I am. My passion to explore new territories and figure out complex problems is what sparked my interest in web development.</p>

						<p>I earned my bachelor's degree in Scientific and Technical Communication at the University of Minnesota in 2013, which helped give me an understanding of front end development, an understanding of web design best practices, and an understanding of how to write and design for the web. My passion for coding came when I decided to create my first website during my senior year. Creating the site was challenging, but that experience helped me uncover my passion. </p>

						<p>After 4 years of working as a technical writer in software development, I decided to follow my dream of becoming a user experience developer. As a result, I enrolled in the University of Minnesota coding boot camp. Since enrolling, my passion for learning about technologies like CSS and Javascript continues to grow. My interest in how those technologies impact the design and user experience of the web is why I'm excited to continue learning more.</pp>

						<h5>How did you become interested in user experience?</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>I first became interested and exposed to user experience testing during my senior year at the University of Minnesota while I was in the Scientific and Technical Communication program. Specifically, during my senior year, I took a usability testing and human factors course. Throughout the course, the class was split up into teams, and each team was responsible for conducting a usability test for a part of the Hennepin County Library website at the University of Minnesota usability lab. As part of this project, the team I was working on completed a heuristic evaluation of the website to help determine usability strengths and weaknesses of the current site. We put together a usability test plan outlining the purpose of the test, the research question, the testing scenarios, and the methodology. We then conducted the test. Finally, we communicated our results and recommendations to the Hennepin County Library. </p>

						<p>This experience was eye-opening for me. First of all, it helped me realized how important user-centered developoment and design of a website really is. It is very important to understand the user and keep the user at the forefront of every design decision. It also helped me understand my purpose as a web developer. That is, my purpose is to make users' lives more simple. An application can look cool and have all these interesting features. But, if a user can't actually accomplish anything with it, doesn't understand what they are supposed to be doing, or if the application is too difficult to use, they aren't going to use it and the app you just built is worthless. Improving the user experience of a site or application is why learned how to code. The user is why I'm passionate about learning and growing as a developer.</p>

						<h5>What do you do when you're not coding?</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>I love to run. I know a lot of people who run just for the exercise and who spend years training for a marathon. I do think running is good for your physical health, and I would definitely like to run a marathon some day. However,I primarily run because I simply enjoy running. For me, running is what relaxes me when I'm stressed. When I start feeling overwhelmed, I simply go for a run. I can go for a run anywhere at any time. So, when I'm not in a coffee shop working on my next coding project, you might find me running along a hiking trail in the Twin Cities.</p>

						<p>In addition to running, I also like to play basketball. I spend at least 4 days a week in the gym working on my 3 point shot, shooting at least 100 3's during a typical workout session. Growing up, I was never the tallest guy on my team nor the best shooter. I had to work 10 times harder than most of my teammates. Despite these obstacles, I continued to play basketball. Despite people telling me that I wasn't good enough, I stuck with basketball. I practiced every day after school. I was always the first one on my team to arrive at the gym before a game and the last one to leave. I never gave up no matter how difficult things got. In fact, my determination is what helped me become the best 3 point shooter on my team, and this mindset is what has helped me get through a challenging 6 months of learning to code at the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp. Just like basketball, coding is tough and frustrating at times. Some days are tougher than other days. There will always be obstacles that I will have to hurdle. But, my hunger and drive to be the best at whatever I do are why I'm excited for what the future holds for me.</p>

						<h5>What role do you typically play on a team?</h5>
					</div>
					<div class="card-body">
						<p>Growing up, I played team sports almost year round, including baseball in the spring and summer, soccer in the fall, and basketball in the winter. So, ever since I was about five or six years old, I had to learn how to work and communicate with others on a team to succeed and achieve a common goal. Whether that goal was winning the championship game or finishing a team project at work before the deadline, teamwork, communication, and everybody knowing his or her role were extremely important. For example, in basketball, the offense runs through the point guard. The point guard is expected to lead the team and call out the plays for the team to execute. Even though the leader of the team is the coach, it is the point guard who helps the team work together and helps make plays happen. Without a point guard to help lead the team, the team is not going to be very cohesive and successful.</p>

						<p>As for myself, when I work with a team on a project, I do consider myself to be like a point guard on a basketball team. That is, I like to lead and manage the project, but I wouldn't consider myself a very outspoken leader like a basketball coach. My role in the group is often mediator. As a mediator, I am a silent, secondary leader on the team. That is, I don't necessarily act as the leader of the team, but I often help the team communicate with one another, make decisions, and help keep the project moving forward. So, just like a point guard is often a game manager, I often find myself on teams where I'm acting as a project manager to help organize and drive the team to reach their goal.</p>

						<p>Whether I'm on the court or at work, I need to know that I can rely on my team and that they can rely on me. As a game manager when playing basketball or as a project manager at work, I want to make sure everyone knows where they are going and what they need to do.</p>
